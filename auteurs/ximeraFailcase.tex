\xmtitle{Ximera Failcase}{What does (not) work?}

\label{xim:failcase}

\xmsection {Mathmode and co}

Mathmode is displayed online via MathJAX. That works quite well, but
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{within} \verb|\text| only a very limited TeX syntax is possible!

For example: \verb|\text{Dit is \textit{italic}}| works in TeX, but NOT in MathJAX!
For example:
$$
({\color{blue}k} \text{ becomes } {\color{blue}l-1})
$$
works, but the following does not:
$$
\text{({\color{blue}$k$} becomes  {\color{blue}$l-1$})}
$$


\item  \verb|\hfill| does not seem to work (correctly)
\item Ximera has a trick to make \verb|\newcommand| work in MathJAX
\item Ximera implements (via some hacking!) \verb|\answer| in MathJax 2.x (but, that does NOT work in MathJAX 3.x)
\end{itemize}

\xmsection{Answers and solutions}

\begin{itemize}
\item in \verb|\answer|, \verb|\dfrac| does not work (correct answer is counted as wrong!); use \verb|\frac|
\end{itemize}

\xmsection {Tables and co}

\begin{example}[align and tag sometimes behave strangely?]
The following \verb|align| does not resize correctly in MathJAX: it jumps out of the frame to the right with relatively small fonts (resolution).


The problem is likely caused by the \verb|tag|. Moreover, it does not seem to work well with \verb|hyperref|, because a reference with \verb|\hyperref[fail:test_tag]{my text}| seems to display the text that is associated with the \verb|label| online(!), instead of the text in the \verb|\hyperref|: see \hyperref[fail:test_tag]{this description}.

Conclusion: avoid \verb|\tag| (or figure it out and adjust this text!)

\begin{align*}
		\important{\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}}  &\iff \important{ad = bc} 
			 \tag*{equality of (numerical value of) fractions (cross multiplication)}\label{fail:test_tag}\\ \\
		\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} \quad&\perdef\quad \frac{ad+cb}{bd} 
			 \tag*{ addition (bringing to a common denominator)}\label{fail:optelling breuken} \\ \\
		\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} \quad&\perdef\quad \frac{a\cdot c}{b\cdot d} 
			 \tag*{multiplication (numerator $\times$ numerator, denominator $\times$ denominator) }\label{fail: vermenigvuldiging breuken} \\ \\
		\frac{a}{b} : \frac{c}{d} \quad&\perdef\quad \frac ab \cdot \frac dc = \frac{a\cdot d}{b\cdot c} 
		  \tag*{division (times by the reciprocal)}\label {fail: deling breuken}  \\
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[tabular becomes very wide online]

A \verb|tabular| tends to occupy the full width online. That is usually not nice. An alternative is to use \verb|array|, which resizes correctly (but of course, they are in math mode!)

With \verb|tabular| (and \verb|center|):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
 x & 1 \\
 y & 2 \\
 z & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

With \verb|array|:
$$
\begin{array}{lr}
 x & 1 \\
 y & 2 \\
 z & 1
\end{array}
$$
\end{example}

\xmsection {Numbering and co}

The numbering of parts, sections, definitions, etc. is done (at least partly) by TeX (for PDF) as well as by Ximera (for online). This is inherently somewhat subtle, and differences may arise at some point. Also, dynamically including sections/ximeras/... or not (pdf/online/handout/...) may and will possibly cause issues with numbering/pagination.
